        Wikipedia says about go,
    <blockquote>"Go is an abstract strategy board game for two players in which the aim is to 
        surround more territory than the opponent. The game was invented in China more than 
        2,500 years ago and is believed to be the oldest board game continuously played to 
        the present day. A 2016 survey by the International Go Federation's 75 member nations 
        found that there are over 46 million people worldwide who know how to play Go and 
        over 20 million current players, the majority of whom live in East Asia."</blockquote>
    
     <br>
    Since go is so old, there are many proverbs and sayings around it. Some are funny, some 
    are useful, some are confusing and some are all three. Here are some of my favorites:
    
    <ul>
        <li><q>Don't go fishing while your house is on fire</q></li>
        <li><q> When in doubt, <a href="https://senseis.xmp.net/?Tenuki"> tenuki </a> </q></li>
        <li><q>Make a fist before striking </q></li>
        <li><q>Nets are better than ladders</q></li>
        <li><q>Lose your first 50 games as fast as you can</q></li>
        <li><q>Riding the tiger, it is difficult to get off</q></li>
        <li><q>The enemy's key point is your's.</q></li>

<h3 id="howtoplay" >How to Play</h3>
<h4 class="instructions">Basics</h4>
The rules of go are fairly straightforward. Each player plays 
stones of one color, black or white. Generally, the less experienced 
player plays the black stones and takes the first turn. A turn consists
of placing a stone of your color on any intersection of lines on the board.
At any point a player may choose to pass their turn. When both players pass 
the game is considered finished and can be scored.

<h4 class="instructions">Life and Death</h4>
<p>When the first stone is played in the middle of the board (or anywhere that
is not on the outer edge of the board) it is considered to have four(4) <b>liberties.</b>
Liberties are what determine if a stone or group of stones is/are considered 
dead or alive. </p>

<figure>
    <img src="4liberties.png" id="four_liberties" class="howtoimg">
<figcaption>The black stone shown here has 4 liberties</figcaption>
</figure>

<br>

<p>When two stones of the same color are directly adjacent to each other, they
    are considered to be connected and therefore, share their liberties. Stones are 
    <b>not</b> considered connected if the are diagonally adjacent only.
</p>

<figure>
    <img src="6liberties.png" id="six_liberties" class="howtoimg">
<figcaption>The group of black stone shown here has 6 liberties, however the other stone is
    not connected and it only has 4.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<br>

<p>
    Stone of opposing colors do not share liberties. If a black group completely surrounds a white 
    group, and the white group has no internal liberties (called "eyes"), black captures the white 
    group and keeps them to add to black's score at the end of the game.
</p>

<br>
<figure>
    <img src="capturing.png" id="capture" class="howtoimg">
<figcaption>The white stone and the black stone both have three liberties in the first image.
    In the second, black is reduced to one liberty. This state of having only one liberty is
    called <b>"atari."</b> In the third image, white has captured the black stone and scores one point.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>You can capture large groups as well as individual stones. <br>
You are not allowed to play moves that would be "suicidal" or moves
that would cause one of your own group's liberties to be reduced to zero. However, 
a move can create liberties by capturing, allowing you to play in spaces that 
would otherwise be suicidal.
</p>

<br>
<figure>
    <img src="groupcap.png" id="group_capture" class="howtoimg">
<figcaption>In the first image the white group has two liberties remaining. Black is unable to play 
    at d3 on their next turn because that stone would have no liberties. In the second image white
     is left with only a single liberty. Now, when black plays d3 in the third image, white is captured
     and black scores 11 points! 
</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>
<p>
    The only way to guarantee that a group will not be captured is to give it (at least) two eyes, or liberties
    the are surrounded by the group. As we saw in a previous example, one eye is not enough because, 
    if the external liberties are all covered by the opponent, our single eye can be filled. But the 
    opponent can only play one stone per turn. Therefore, if the group has two internal liberties (eyes) 
    it can never be captured. More eyes are better(more points!), but if you have two, you will never die.
</p>

<figcaption>The black group is small, but safe!

<h4 class="instructions">Ko</h4>
<p><b>Ko</b> can be a very tricky concept. If it were not for the rule of ko, it would be easy for games
    to repeat the same two board positions over and over again as the players fight for a single 
    capture with no way to resolve it. The website 
    <a href="https://senseis.xmp.net/?Ko">sensei's library</a> 
    does a good job of explaining this rule.

<h4 class="instructions">Score</h4>

<p>
There are two main sets of rules for scoring a game of go, <b>area scoring</b> and <b>territory scoring.</b>
In territory scoring, your score is the number of empty points surrounded by only your stones
plus the number of stones you captured from your opponent. If you played white, you also get 
extra points, called <b>komi</b>, for going second. Usually komi is worth 6.5 points. This is to 
compensate for going second. It also means that the scores can not be tied because black
can not score half of a point.

<h3 id="wheretoplay">Where to play</h3>

<p>The most popular website for English speakers to play go on is <a href="https://online-go.com">OGS (Online Go Server).</a>
    It is also the easiest to use because it only requires an account, which is free to sign up for.
    You can play in your browser, so no software needs to be downloaded or installed, which is very
    convenient.    
</p>
<p>
    There are other servers such as 
    <a href="https://lutris.net/games/fox-go-server/" >Fox</a> and 
    <a href="http://www.tygemgo.com/">Tygem</a>
    which are more popular among players in Eastern Asia and more competitive players. However, both of these servers
    require the user to download and install their software and, due to their age, are generally less user-friendly
    than OGS.
